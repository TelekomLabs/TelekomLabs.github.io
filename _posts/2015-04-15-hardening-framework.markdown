description: The goal of the <a href="http://hardening.io">Hardening Framework</a> is simply to create a common layer for hardening operating systems and services easily and without interference. Even if you aren't knee-deep in configuration manuals for services or the latest security recommendations, you will be able to implement and use this framework with ease.
