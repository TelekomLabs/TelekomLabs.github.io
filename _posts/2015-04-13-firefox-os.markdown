description: The prevalent operating systems used for today's smartphones have one thing in common&#58; they are designed to function as "closed" operating systems. Neither users nor network operators can make any independent decisions that would impact the services used â€“ they must accept the structures as defined by the developers. One way to solve this dilemma would be the consequent use of open standards such as HTML5 and the migration of key functionalities into the cloud. That is why Telekom has established a partnership with the Mozilla Foundation, which develops such a system for smartphones with Boot to Gecko (Firefox OS). The <a href="https://github.com/svic">Labs are making important contributions</a> to this project when it comes to device security and the development of a unique user interface.
